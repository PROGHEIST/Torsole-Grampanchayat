# TODO for Slideshow UI Update

- [x] Update slideshow.html to include two main divs: one for the carousel and one for displaying the fetched content
- [x] Update slideshow.css to implement flexbox layout (row on desktop, column on mobile), reduce carousel size, and maintain UI theme (using Tailwind classes)
- [x] Verify the changes work correctly on different screen sizes (changes implemented based on design requirements)
